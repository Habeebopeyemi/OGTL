# Welcome to My Spaceship
***

## Task
Modelling the movement of a Spaceship, with set of instruction
passed as string, representing the path the Spaceship is to follow
through out it movement in the space.
Major challenge of the spaceship project is getting the returned coordinate
and direction formatted correctly.
## Description
The approach of separation of concern was adopted in solving this challenge.
A method "get_coordinate" and "find_direction" was use getting the final coordinate
and the direction of the spaceship respectively.
Different cases was tested using switch statement to pass the right instruction to the spaceship
